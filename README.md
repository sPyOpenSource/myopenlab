# MyOpenLab
Java based Software for Graphical Programming. In particular, MyOpenLab seems to be widely used to develop control programs that can run on Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards. 
Though MyOpenLab may behave a bit like LabVIEW, it is based on Java and has an internal structure that is completely different. It allows users to create and simulate applications and components using graphical blocks that have different functions and properties.

MyOpenLab has an architecture that is not oriented around flow programming; it is what's called event driven. In event-driven programs, events determine the flow of the program. 
Typical events include mouse clicks, key presses, and messages from other programs. Perhaps for obvious reasons, graphical user interfaces typically are built around event-driven architectures.
